      <h2>Newborn Sessions</h2>
      <p class="lead">Welcoming a new baby into the family is such a special and memorable time. Sessions at the hospital document the first hours and meetings, such as siblings. Sessions at home capture the family in a relaxed, familiar setting, usually in the nursery, living room, or master bedroom.</p>
