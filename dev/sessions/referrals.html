      <h2>Referral Program</h2>
      <p>Referring friends and family is truly the best compliment I could receive, and it means the world to me each and every time. As a small business owner, I couldnâ€™t continue serving amazing families without this support. As a thank you for spreading the word about Karen Schanely Photography, you will receive a <strong>$50 session credit</strong> for each friend who books a session! AND they will also receive a $25 print credit when they mention your name!</p>
      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Refer a friend to Karen Schanely Photography.</li>
        <li>They need to mention your name and referral at the time they book their session. They will then receive a $25 print credit to use in their online session gallery.</li>
        <li>Once their session booked and paid in full, you will receive an email with a $50 session credit.</li>
        <li>You may earn and combine as many session credits as you like!</li>
        <li>Only one person may receive the referral credit. More than one person may refer the friend, but only one person may receive the $50 session credit.</li>
        <li>Referral credits do not have cash out value.</li>
        <li>Referral credits are not transferable between people.</li>
      </ul>
